# Privacy Policy - WhoisExtractor: Email Tool

**Last Updated:** November 12, 2025

## Simple Summary

WhoisExtractor is a browser extension that extracts email addresses from text and files. **Everything happens on your computer** - nothing is sent to the internet.

**In Plain English:**
- ✅ Your files and text stay on your computer
- ✅ We don't collect any of your data
- ✅ We don't track what you do
- ✅ We don't see what emails you extract
- ✅ No sign-up or account needed

## How Your Data is Processed

### Everything Stays Local

When you use this extension:

1. **Files you upload** → Only read by your browser, never sent anywhere
2. **Emails you extract** → Only shown to you, never stored or sent
3. **Settings you change** → Saved in your browser only (like a bookmark)

**Think of it like a calculator** - it does the work on your device, nothing leaves your computer.

### Technical Processing (For Large Files)

For files larger than 256 KB (about 50 pages of text), we use a browser feature called "Web Workers" to prevent freezing. This is **still 100% local** - it's just using a different part of your browser's memory.

**Simple analogy:** It's like using more RAM on your computer - faster processing, but still private to you.

## What We Store

### On Your Computer (Chrome Storage)

**Where it's stored:** Chrome's secure storage (same place as your bookmarks)  
**Who can access it:** Only you, on your computer  
**How to delete:** Uninstall the extension or clear Chrome data

### What We DO NOT Store

## Permissions Explained

When you install this extension, Chrome asks for permissions. Here's what they mean:

| Permission | What It Does | Why We Need It |
|------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Storage** | Save your settings (like "sort emails") | So you don't have to re-select options every time |
| **Offscreen** | Use background processing for large files | Keeps browser responsive with big files (300 MB+) |

**That's it!** No access to your browsing, no internet connection, no data collection.
